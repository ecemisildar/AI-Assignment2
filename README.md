# AIRO2 Assignment 2
This project was developed at the University of Genoa in the academic year 2022/2023 during the Artificial Intelligence for Robotics II course.
The goal is to solve the Task-Motion Planning (TMP) problem for a robot moving in a 2D-environment that needs to collect two assignments and bring them to a final destination.

Compiling and running
----------------------
The planning engine used is popf3-clp and is in the repository folder, so it does not require further installments. To compile the code and run the planning engine, it is first necessary to make them executable and then it is enough to launch the script run.sh:
``` bash
$ sudo chmod +x popf3-clp
$ sudo chmod +x run.sh
$ ./run.sh
```
